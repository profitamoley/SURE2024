# Identifying the source of LGT in Alloteropsis semialata

Lateral gene transfer (LGT) is the movement of genetic material between organisms without sexual reproduction. Originally this was thought to be restricted to bacteria, but we now know it occurs in a wide range of plants, animals and fungi. This project will focus on grass-to-grass LGT in Alloteropsis semialata, a well-studied organism in the context of LGT.

One of the previously identified fragments of foreign DNA in the Alloteropsis semialata genome contains a region of chloroplast DNA within it. Chloroplast DNA is often used to identify plants, and from this  we know that it was acquired from the genus Eremochloa, but we don't know which species. We will use whole-genome data from multiple herbarium samples of various Eremachloa species (n = 12) to determine which species was the donor. 

I assembled the whole chloroplast genomes from the raw data, and used this to build phylogenetic trees to determine which species the sequence in the Alloteropsis semialata genome is most closely related to.

## Step 1: Assembling Eremochloa chloroplast DNA with GetOrganelle

## Step 2: Assembling Alloteropis whole genomes using Hifiasm

## Step 3: Annotating Alloteropsis genomes with Helixer

## Step 4: Mapping Alloteropsis to Eremochloa with Bowtie2

## Step 5: Building a phylogeny
